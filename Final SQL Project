--For this project, I have analyzed data within a database that includes 11 tables. 
--I have explored relationships within and between tables in order to identify interesting insights. 

#1--Find the song, album, and artist of tracks included in the 'Heavy Metal Class' playlist, and order the results by artist, alphabetically. 

SELECT p.name AS playlist,
t.name AS song,
a.Title AS album,
ar.name AS artist
FROM chinook.playlists p
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON p.PlaylistId=pt.PlaylistId
JOIN tracks t
ON pt.TrackId=t.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid=a.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON a.artistid=ar.artistid
WHERE playlist='Heavy Metal Classic'
Order by artist;

#2--How many tracks are on the 'Heavy Metal Classic' playlist?

SELECT COUNT(t.name)
FROM chinook.playlists p
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON p.PlaylistId=pt.PlaylistId
JOIN tracks t
ON pt.TrackId=t.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid=a.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON a.artistid=ar.artistid
WHERE p.name='Heavy Metal Classic';

#3--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT c.firstname, 
c.lastname,
c.customerId,
c.country
FROM chinook.customers c
WHERE country !='USA';

#4--How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#5--What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#6--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.lastname,e.firstname,ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON C.Customerid=i.customerid
GROUP BY e.firstname

#7--What is the sales total for each country? Group results by country and show which countries have the highest total sales first.

SELECT billingcountry, 
       ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY billingcountry
ORDER by total_sales DESC;

#8--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON t.trackid=i.trackid;

#9--Provide a query that shows all the Tracks. Include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name AS track, 
       a.title AS album, 
       g.name AS genre, 
       media.name AS Media_Type
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.genreid = t.genreid
JOIN chinook.media_types media
ON media.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid

#10--Identify the number of customers in each country, and order results from most to least.  

SELECT COUNT (CustomerID) AS Customer_Count, Country
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY  country
ORDER BY customer_count desc
