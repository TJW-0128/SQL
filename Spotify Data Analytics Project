*** This project contains metrics from a Spotify database downloaded from Kaggle.com
*** First, I downloaded the data from Kaggle.
*** Then I created a table into which to insert the procured data.
*** Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

** Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

*** Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

*** Next, I explored the data, answering the following questions and using the following SQL. 

1--/* Which artist(s) had the most songs in the top 50 in 2021? (There was a tie, so I limited results the the top two tied artists).

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)AS number_of_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_of_songs desc
LIMIT 2


2--/*What is the average danceability of songs sung by Olivia Rodrigo?*/

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability_of_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'

3--/*What were the top 10 songs based on energy levels?*/

SELECT track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10


4--/*What was the tempo of the 5 least popular songs?*/

SELECT track_name,tempo, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 5

5--/*What are the tempos of songs by Doja Cat based on popularity?*/

SELECT artist_name,track_name,tempo, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY popularity desc

6--/*Between Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat, Ariana Grande, and Olivia Rodrigo, 
which artist's songs had the highest mood on average? 
What was that rating?*/

SELECT distinct artist_name, AVG(valence) AS happiness_rating
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Ed Sheeran'
OR artist_name ='Doja Cat'
OR artist_name = 'Ariana Grande'
OR artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(valence)desc
LIMIT 1
